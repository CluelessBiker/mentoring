# MILESTONE #1 :

### </ >Main Technologies
Required: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Optional: jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, external APIs.

### MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

1. Dynamic Front End Project: Write custom JavaScript, HTML and CSS code to create a front-end web application consisting of one or more HTML pages with significant interactive functionality.
2. Site Responses: Use JavaScript to have the site produce relevant responses dependent on users' actions.
3. Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu (unless irrelevant) and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
4. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
5. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
6. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
7. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

**This [document](docs/ms2-loa.pdf) contains the full list**

### README :
- [ ] Written with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [ ] Commit the README the same way you commit your project : "doc(readme): added testing steps"
- [ ] Screenshot of the finished site from [AM I RESPONSIVE](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
- [ ] Explanation of the site's purpose - key project goals, target audience
- [ ] User stories - As a **user** I want to **fill out the contact form** so that I can **contact the company**
- [ ] Design : Wireframes (sketch is fine), colour palette, typography - & why you chose them
- [ ] Screenshots of all site features (Nav bar | footer | tables | etc...) accompanied by an explanation of what each feature does & link to the relevant user story.
- [ ] Thorough testing steps & screenshots of validator testing - Explain the principles of automated and manual testing and when each might be deployed.
- [ ] All deployment steps including initial steps to clone the repo (git add/commit/push | deploy to github pages)
- [ ] Credit code & media sources - Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
- [ ] Pass README through a spell checker!

### TESTING AS A TABLE :
**TEST** | **ACTION** | **EXPECTATION** | **RESULT** 
----------|----------|----------|----------
Home page | Size to 320px using Chrome Dev Tools	| Elements look good @ 320px | Works as expected
Home page | Size to 1920px using Chrome Dev Tools | Elements look good 1920px | Works as expected
Contact form | Click send button without data in form fields | Cannot submit form | Works as expected
Nav bar - home page | Click nav buttons | That each nav element takes me to the correct page site page | Works as expected

- To achieve the above table, this is what the formatting your README will look like :
```
**TEST** | **ACTION** | **EXPECTATION** | **RESULT** 
----------|----------|----------|----------
Home page	| Size to 320px using Chrome Dev Tools	| Elements look good @ 320px | Works as expected
Home page	| Size to 1920px using Chrome Dev Tools | Elements look good 1920px | Works as expected
Contact form | Click send button without data in form fields | Cannot submit form | Works as expected
Nav bar - home page | Click nav buttons | That each nav element takes me to the correct page site page | Works as expected
```
