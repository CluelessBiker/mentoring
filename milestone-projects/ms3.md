# MILESTONE #4 :

### </> MAIN TECHNOLOGIES :
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, PostgreSQL OR MongoDB

Additional libraries and external APIs

### MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS :
1. Data handling: Build a Relational OR Non-Relational Database backed Flask project for a web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
2. Database structure: Put some effort into designing a database structure well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between records of different entities.
3. User functionality: Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records (CRUD functionality).
4. Use of technologies: Use HTML and custom CSS for the website's front-end.
5. Structure: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Materialize or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
6. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
7. Version control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
8. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
9. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
10. Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository.

### !IMPORTANT NOTE! :
- Feel free to reuse the authentication from the mini-project. The focus of this milestone project is on the data, rather than any business logic.

**This [document](ms3-loa.pdf) contains the full list***

### README :
- [ ] Written with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [ ] Commit the README the same way you commit your project : "doc(readme): added testing steps"
- [ ] Screenshot of the finished site from [AM I RESPONSIVE](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
- [ ] Explanation of the site's purpose - key project goals, target audience
- [ ] User stories - As a **user** I want to **fill out the contact form** so that I can **contact the company**
- [ ] Design : Wireframes (sketch is fine), colour palette, typography - & why you chose them
- [ ] Screenshots of all site features (Nav bar | footer | tables | etc...) accompanied by an explanation of what each feature does.
- [ ] Show & explain your ERD model (your database structure & how your models relate to each other : I recommend using [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) for this
- [ ] Thorough testing steps & screenshots of validator testing
- [ ] All deployment steps including initial steps to clone the repo (git add/commit/push | deploy to github pages)
- [ ] Credit code & media sources
- [ ] Pass README through a spell checker!

### TESTING AS A TABLE :
**TEST** | **ACTION** | **EXPECTATION** | **RESULT** 
----------|----------|----------|----------
Home page | Size to 320px using Chrome Dev Tools	| Elements look good @ 320px | Works as expected
Home page | Size to 1920px using Chrome Dev Tools | Elements look good 1920px | Works as expected
Contact form | Click send button without data in form fields | Cannot submit form | Works as expected
Nav bar - home page | Click nav buttons | That each nav element takes me to the correct page site page | Works as expected

- To achieve the above table, this is what the formatting your README will look like :
```
**TEST** | **ACTION** | **EXPECTATION** | **RESULT** 
----------|----------|----------|----------
Home page	| Size to 320px using Chrome Dev Tools	| Elements look good @ 320px | Works as expected
Home page	| Size to 1920px using Chrome Dev Tools | Elements look good 1920px | Works as expected
Contact form | Click send button without data in form fields | Cannot submit form | Works as expected
Nav bar - home page | Click nav buttons | That each nav element takes me to the correct page site page | Works as expected
```
